## Description

## Technologies

- `Redux ToolKit`
- `React-Bootstrap`, `Bootstrap`
- `HTML/CSS/JS stack`

## Dependencies

#### The following dependencies are required to run this app:

- `"@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.9.3"`
- `"bootstrap": "^5.2.3"`
- `"bootstrap-icons": "^1.10.3"`
- `"react": "^18.2.0"`
- `"react-bootstrap": "^2.7.2"`
- `"react-dom": "^18.2.0"`
- `"react-redux": "^8.0.5"`
- `"react-router-dom": "^6.8.1"`

## Project Structure

The web application has a wide range of client components that provide a variety of functionality for the user. Components are divided by functionality and are responsible for different aspects of the application, such as navigation, product display, user registration and authorization, as well as storage and processing of shopping cart and feedback data. Many different technologies and practices are used, such as Redux to manage application state, custom hooks to simplify component logic, and data validation in forms.

Components that display pages and main content such as "MenuProducts", "Slider", "WhyWe", "ProductCard", "AllFoods", "Cart", "Checkout", "Contact", "FoodDetails", "Profile" , "Home", "Login", and "Register", implement various functions and interact with the Redux store to save and update data. Each of these components has its own unique functionality and set of actions that the user can perform.

However, the components "Basket", "CartItem", "CartTable", "cartsLikedSlice", and "basketUISlice" are responsible for working with the shopping cart and list of likes. They provide the ability to add, remove, and update cart items, as well as display related messages and statuses.

Finally, custom hooks such as "useGetAllProducts", "useReview", "useValidationAuthForms", and "useValidFormsBtn" help to simplify and optimize the component logic, providing the required functionality and user interaction.
