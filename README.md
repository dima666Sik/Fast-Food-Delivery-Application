  - Database integration for storing and managing user, product, and other relevant data, ensuring robust data persistence.
  - Comprehensive support for CRUD operations, including data validation and necessary business logic checks for input requests.
  - Implementation of modular and integration tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of microservices.

This architecture not only optimizes backend performance but also ensures data security, reliability, and a smooth user experience.
